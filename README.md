# Coursera: Programming Languages

This repository hosts code completed for the [Coursera Programming Languages course, by Dan Grossman](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages). The course studied programming languages, using SML in Part A, Racket in Part B, and Ruby in Part C to showcase programming language features and design through the lens of these three quite different languages. The course covered a wide range of material, including recursion, pattern matching, interpreters, streams, and mixins.

Probably the most interesting code is the interperter for the course-defined MUPL language, written in Racket, found in [Part B, week 2, homework 5](https://github.com/bmitc/coursera-programming-languages/blob/main/part-b/week-2/hw5.rkt).
